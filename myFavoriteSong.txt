I tried so hard
And got so far
But in the end
It doesn't even matter

I had to fall
To lose it all
But in the end
It doesn't even matter



Yo one thing, one thing I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind I designed this rhyme to explain the due time
All I know, time to so-socialize like the host of the party
